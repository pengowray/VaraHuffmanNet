# VaraHuffmanNet

VARA HF's Huffman Encoding algorithm, updated to VB.NET.

Project Goals

* Document the Huffman Encoding format of VARA protocol, which is used with WinLink on amateur radio.
* Create a reference implementation which runs on modern operating systems and compiles on current compilers.

Notes

* VARA does not stand for anything. 
* Proprietary VARA software is developed by EA5HVK.
* The original VB6/pseudocode is published by VARA's author in a PDF rather than source code file, on a paywalled site.
* This project may contain propritory code. All my own contributions are MIT licensed.
